* spike 'autostrap': automatically strap-on reader methods using normalised name
* [DONE] render generic output (sigma.js json) for ingestion -> space-dog
* sort out fore vs back color
* [DONE] move 'cluster_' prefix to graphviz renderer
* clean up init options + render attributes - not v clear / overlapping
* make style attributes well defined -> less leaky + explicit graphviz passthroughs
* separate style from domain-specific elements (can use same view-manipulation selection mechanisms)
  - info holds all real / domain attributes
  - style holds all view / representation attributes
* move out any graphviz specifics from main models, e.g. colorize
* move from inheritance -> better encaps
* make everything a thing:
  - things become containers when have other things
  - gets away from "container" which is a bit confusing inline in infra description
  - maybe makes more seamless when collapsing/hiding for different views?
* add sankey diagrams?
* other renderer integrations:
  - plantuml?
  - cyctoscape?
* switch to proper graph lib under covers - this is just a builder + view wrapper...
